# I'm Catija - Hire me!

I find myself in search of my next full-time opportunity. I love finding organizations that really care about making sure their products meet the needs of their commmunity. If that's you, read on to learn about my skills and interests to determine if you think I'd be a good fit for your team!

## Who am I?

Hiya! I'm Catija - I love enabling communities and creating or improving products - if I can do both at once, even better!

I believe that no one is better placed to understand where a product is struggling than the people who use it and that communities who feel heard deepen their connection with the products they use. 

When I work as a liaison between communities and product owners I: 

- listen to and ask questions about community struggles to deeply understand them from all angles and identify potential solutions
- understand past decisions that led to the status quo and question whether it's the best course of action
- identify the optimal solution by utilizing any avenues available to me, particularly data, additional feedback from users, and testing.
- Support the team (e.g. designers and developers) to ensure they have the information they need to do their job well.
- Documenting or updating documentation once the final product ships and ensure the community is aware of the changes
- Ensure outstanding issues or bugs are triaged and addressed shortly after being reported.

## Qualities of places where I'll thrive

I do my best work when 

- I care about the work I'm doing and my work is making a difference. I need to work on something I believe in, shares my values, and where I see room for improvement. 
- transparancy is paramount to the organization and I'm free to communicate publicly about my work and future plans.
- I have autonomy, support, and resources. As trusted team member, give me room to find my own solutions, access to the people I need to do my job well, and the tools I need to make it happen.
- I get timely, open, and honest feedback from peers. Everyone should be told when they do things well but I need to know when I've put a foot wrong and how I can do better.

## Opportunities that aren't for me:

I've learned a lot about myself over the years and there are some things that just aren't a good fit. 

- sales
- marketing / social
