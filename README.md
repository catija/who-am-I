# I'm Catija - Hire me!

I find myself in search of my next full-time opportunity. I love finding organizations that prioritize ensuring their products meet the needs of their commmunity. If that's you, read on to learn about my skills and interests to determine how I might fit into your team!

## Who am I?

Hiya! I'm Catija - I love enabling communities and improving products - if I can do both at once, even better!

I believe that no one is better placed to understand where a product can be improved than the people who use it. When community members feel heard, they deepen their connection with the products they use because they feel a sense of ownership. I'm looking for an opportunity to work as part of a cross-functional team whose purpose is to work closely with an engaged and thoughtful community with the goal of improving a product to better meet their needs.

There are a lot of titles that cover this role depending on the organization but titles aren't too important provided the role includes both direct community engagement. Instead of relying on titles, let's talk about how I empower community members to get the most out of the product and tools they're using.

When I work as a liaison between communities and product owners I: 

- investigate what improvements are needed and what got us there in the first place. This can include
  - listening to and asking questions about community struggles to deeply understand them from multiple angles.
  - understanding the history of the existing product and process to identify what works and what needs to change.
- identify the optimal solution by utilizing any avenues available to me, particularly data, additional feedback from users, and testing.
- Support the team (e.g. designers and developers) to ensure they have the information they need to do their job well.
- Documenting or updating documentation once the final product ships and ensure the community is aware of the changes
- Ensure outstanding issues or bugs are triaged and addressed shortly after being reported.

Some keywords that describe me:

- community advocate
- communicator
- helper
- enabler
- connector
- resourceful
- curious
- transparent


## Qualities of places where I'll thrive

I do my best work when 

- I care about the work I'm doing and my work is making a difference. I need to work on something I believe in, shares my values, and where I see room for improvement. 
- transparancy is paramount to the organization and I'm free to communicate publicly about my work and future plans.
- I have autonomy, support, and resources. As trusted team member, give me room to find my own solutions, access to the people I need to do my job well, and the tools I need to make it happen.
- I get timely, open, and honest feedback from peers. Everyone should be told when they do things well but I need to know when I've put a foot wrong and how I can do better.

## Opportunities that aren't for me:

I've learned a lot about myself over the years and there are some things that just aren't a good fit. 

- sales
- marketing / social
